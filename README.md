#Text classification
This is a collection of Ipython/Jupyter notebooks introducing text classification approaches and related NLP/ML concepts. I use this mainly to document my learning process and keep track of stuff that I do/did in classes at Bielefeld University ([Semantic Computing Group](http://www.sc.cit-ec.uni-bielefeld.de/index.php?id=29), [Dialogue Systems Group](http://www.dsg-bielefeld.de/dsg_wp/), [Theoretical Computer Science for Cognitive Systems](https://www.cit-ec.de/tcs/)) and University of Warwick ([Foundations of Data Analytics](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/modules/cs910/)). I put special emphasis on trying to understand and explain the involved math, as I have received comparatively little formal training so far. This might, hopefully, also be useful to others.
